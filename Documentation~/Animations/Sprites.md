# Sprites

Every animation that involves a sprite is included in this module.

## `SpriteAnimation`

`ScriptableObject` that stores a collection of sprites, that are used to create an animation.

## `DirectedAnimation`

`ScriptableObject` that stores and manages `SpriteAnimation`s for every direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). It is mainly useful to animate characters actions, such as *walking* and *interacting*.

More information on `SpriteAnimator`s can be consulted at [`SpriteAnimators.md`](./SpriteAnimators.md).
